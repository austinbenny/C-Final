\section{Introduction}

In this project, students are tasked with building an explicit simulation of disease propagation using C++. The person is an object, and the population is an object that is a collection of person objects. We begin by infecting one person and tracking their status over a number of days. This simple model is scaled up to contain a collection of people where each individual's status is monitored. An infection and random interactions are then introduced to make the simulation more realistic.The program will then track the population from day to day, running indefinitely until none of the population is sick. Since there is no re-infection, the run will always end.\\

The foundational model of the project is as follows:\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sick $\Rightarrow$ they can infect other people
	\item Susceptible $\Rightarrow$ they can be infected
	\item Recovered $\Rightarrow$ they have been sick, but no longer carry the disease and cannot be infected
	\item Inoculated $\Rightarrow$ they do not carry the disease and can not be sick
\end{enumerate}

\section{Joe: Individual person}

For the first section of the project, a model of one person with probability of infection is introduced. The default number of days a person can be sick is set to 5 days and remains that way to the end of the program. The main methods serve to infect a person, and to track their state. The other methods serve to gauge the person's status. The methods of the \texttt{Person} class are as follows:\\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  \texttt{status\_string()} : returns a description of the person’s state
	\item \texttt{update()} :  update the person’s status to the next day
	\item \texttt{infect(n)} : returns a description of the person’s state
	\item \texttt{is\_stable()} : report whether the person has been sick and is recovered
\end{enumerate}

	\label{tab:table}
\end{table}

\subsection{Discussion}

As Table \ref{tab:table} shows, as the probability of infection is increased in 10\% increments, the number of days it takes Joe to become inoculated decreases because he gets infected faster. So if the tolerance is 10\% I would expect the \texttt{if(tolerance > bad\_luck)} condition to be \texttt{true} later on in the run-time of the program; whereas, if the tolerance were 70\% I would expect the if condition to be met sooner than if the tolerance were 10\%. As the probability of infection is 80\%, Joe immediately gets infected and the number of days will be 5 because it takes Joe 5 days by default to be recovered after sick. I would expect the number of days to be constant at 5 after the probability of 80\% because if the probability generated at the iteration that corresponds to when Joe gets infected, increasing the probability won't change anything. This is because the program is using a quasi-random number generator, so essentially the random numbers created are the same for every new run of the program. To better show this result, please see Figure \ref{fig:probvdays}.

\section{Population}

The bulk of the report centers around how the disease spreads in the population. To model the spreading, a form of the The SIR model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 comes is employed. The program starts out with infecting one random person in a vector of \texttt{Person} objects of a user-defined  \textbf{size} passed to the population class. This random person has the ability to infect their neighbors if a certain \textbf{probability} $\in$ $[0,1]$ is met. If the neighbors are recovered or inoculated, that neighbor cannot be infected. Each infected person has contact with \textbf{n} other people in the population per day. Before infecting anyone, a certain \textbf{percentage} of the population is inoculated.\\

As we can see from the bolded items above, there are 4 parameters to vary at 3 relative conditions (low, medium, and high) for a maximum of 64 set of data or graphs able to be created from the simulation. The simulation can be described as

\begin{align*} 
   f(Probability, Percentage, n, Size) = [S,I,R,IN] \\
\end{align*}

Where the right-hand side corresponds to the number of susceptible, infected, recovered, and inoculated people predicted by the initial conditions. 64 graphs is time consuming and most of those graphs will not inform anybody. For example, It is obvious that if the percentage of inoculated people in my population is high (95\%) and the probability of transfer of the infection is low (5\%) the number of infected people in my population (with all things held constant) will be relatively low. So running this simulation will not be worthwhile; instead, in the Discussion section attention is given to the peculiar and enlightening trends from varying the parameters, especially the phenomenon of herd immunity.\\

\subsection{Shortcomings}

At certain sections in the simulation, the limitations of C++ become irksome. For example, when the population size is medium ($\approx$ 100 people), and the inoculation percentage is relatively high ($\approx$ 80\%), the program will only randomly infect $\approx$ 50 people. For example, If the simulation has a size of 100 and the inoculation percentage is 80\% as given above, the program will only infect 50 people instead of 80. For extremely high ($\approx$ 95\%) the program fails to move to the inoculation stage due to a segmentation fault. The output of the \texttt{repeat.m} MATLAB script demonstrates that for the array of random numbers between the population size (100 in this case), a little less than half of the numbers in the array are repeated again.\\

\begin{verbatim}

%Size of A is 75

A = [84,87,78,16,94,36,87,93,50,...
    22,63,28,91,60,64,27,41,27,73,...
    37,12,69,68,30,83,31,63,24,68,...
    36,30,3,23,59,70,68,94,57,12,43,...
    30,74,22,20,85,38,99,25,16,71,...
    14,27,92,81,57,74,63,71,97,82,6,...
    26,85,28,37,6,47,30,14,58,25,96,83,46,15];
.
.
.
>> repeat
Size of B is 50

\end{verbatim}


B is a vector that employs the built-in MATLAB function \texttt{unique()} that extracts only the elements in A that are non-repeating. So, A, the array of size 75 has 15 repeating elements. Since the simulation criteria prohibit inoculating someone who is already inoculated, the 15 repeating numbers are ignored. This reduction in the final people inoculated is most likely because the seed for the random number generator is not changed or updated at every trial. Therefore, even if the size of the population is increased to 1000 people, the number of inoculated will be $\approx$ 50\% of that or around 500 people. This is a limitation of not only C++ but any programming language with a quasi-random number generator.\\

\subsection{Results}

Below are the plots created from the data by varying several parameters of the program with the population size held constant (100 people). Please note, that since the program begins with \texttt{while(count\_infected() != 0)}, after the \texttt{while()} conditions is met, the program stops getting data on the number of inoculated, recovered, and sick. So the final marker on the x-axis represents the conditions of the people the day before everyone was recovered.\\

\subsection{Discussion}

Figure \ref{fig:a} represents the control result; this graph represents the results when the disease is given an opportunity to run through the population without a major impedance such as a high proportion of inoculated in the population. Since the percentage of inoculated is 5\%, 5 people in the population will be inoculated and stay that way throughout the end of the program, represented by the red dotted line. The number of infected rises steadily as patient-zero is given an opportunity to infect his neighbors, and since a relatively small number of the population are inoculated, more and more people will be infected. Day 5 marks the inflection point for the infected population, the green dotted line steadily decreases from a high of about 30 people. As a consequence of this, the number of people recovered increases and the number susceptible people decrease as shown by \ref{fig:a}. The number of infected decreases after day 5 because the at that point, around half the population is either infected, inoculated, or recovered and the program only has a 50\% chance of infecting a susceptible person.\\

Figure \ref{fig:b} represents the case where a half the population is infected and the disease has a high probability of transfer. In this case, the program infects 3 people on day 2 and fails to infect anybody else. Analogously, Figure \ref{fig:e} represents the case where more than half the population is inoculated and the disease has a high probability of transfer and looks very similar to Figure \ref{fig:b}.\\

On the converse of that, Figure \ref{fig:f} represents the case where a moderate proportion of the population is infected and the disease has a high probability of transfer. This result is odd, because even though only 25\% of the population are inoculated, only a total of 5 people are ever infected through the course of the program. I would expect the script, when randomly choosing a \texttt{Person} to infect from the population, would have a good probability of selecting another soul at every iteration since only 25\% are inoculated.\\

To further investigate this result, the number of people contacted per day was increased from 6 to 50. Figure \ref{fig:c} represents the other control case where a low percentage of the population are inoculated and the disease has a low probability of transfer. This trends in this graph are similar to the ones in Figure \ref{fig:a} with one stark difference. Since the number of people contacted per day is so high, one day in this population produces a large number of infected  as evidenced by the peak number infected at 60. This peculiar result is driven home by Figure \ref{fig:d}; this graph looks very similar to Figure \ref{fig:e} as the number of infected, even when one person comes in contact with 50 other people, peaks at 5. Furthermore, the percentage of the population inoculated is set to 25\% so I would expect the program to infect more than 5 people before eradicating the disease.\\

Figure \ref{fig:b}, \ref{fig:d}, \ref{fig:e}, and \ref{fig:f} are a consequence of what epidemiologists colloquial refer to as ``herd immunity''. Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a decent percentage of a population has become inoculated, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune \cite{herd}. In a population in which a large number of individuals are immune, chains of infection are likely to be disrupted, which stops or slows the spread of disease \cite{herd2}. The greater the proportion of individuals in a community who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who are not immune will come into contact with an infectious individual \cite{herd}. For example, since 25\% of the population are inoculated in the population representing Figure \ref{fig:d}, the other 75\% are protected by herd immunity, hence the low total of infected persons. The health of the inoculated disrupts the chain of infection going around this population.\\

Holding the number of people contacted per day and the probability of transfer constant at 6, and 85\%, the percentage of the population inoculated is varied. This relationship can be described as follows:\\

\begin{align*} 
   f(Percentage) = [Infected] \\
\end{align*}

Table \ref{tab:table2} contains the results.\\

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\footnotesize\setlength{\tabcolsep}{5.5pt}
	\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{6pt}} *{22}{c}}

		& 10 & 15 & 20 & 25 & 30 & 35 & 40 & 50 & 60 \\
		\bfseries Peak Infected
		& 27 & 5 & 16 & 5 & 7 & 12 & 8 & 4 & 5 \\
		\bottomrule
		\addlinespace
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Affect on the highest number of infected as probability is varied}

\end{table}

\begin{figure}[t]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{trendline} 
      \caption{Linear trend-line showing the inversely proportional relationship between percentage of infected and peak number of infected.}
   \label{fig:trend}
\end{figure}

As the trend-line in Figure \ref{fig:trend} clearly shows, as the percentage of inoculated is increased, the peak number of infected decreases. The figure also shows that after about 35\% the peak number of infected never rises over that value of 12. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that if 30-35\% of the population is inoculated, the disease will have a difficult time propagating even under a high probability of transfer. It is also import to note that the program predicted a peak number of infected of 5 and 7 at 15\% and 25\% respectively. However, this can be attributed to the randomness of the random number generator.\\

\newpage
\section{Conclusion}

Not everybody in a population has access to vaccines and excellent medical care, but as this simple SIR simulation has shown, if a decent proportion of the population (in this case $\approx$ 30\%) is inoculated they can act as a shield for their susceptible counterparts. When infectious diseases are spreading, it is vital for those members of that population who can be inoculated to be inoculated. If the members of the population are lethargic and \textit{Laissez-faire} a large number of people will be infected and the population will take considerable amount longer to eradicate the infection as evidenced by Figure \ref{fig:a}.\\

It is also important to note that as infected members of the population contact an excessive amount of people per day, the number of infected people in the population will naturally have a huge chance of increasing as evidenced by \ref{fig:c}. To thwart this result, quarantines and sick days are employed.\\

Each person is different; socio-economic status and access to healthcare, proclivity towards disease, concentration of infected people in the vicinity, variations in individuals understanding of propagation, and many other factors must be employed to create a useable model. Even though this model is too simplistic for real world epidemics, it provides an excellent introduction to the propagation of disease and computational models in epidemiology.
